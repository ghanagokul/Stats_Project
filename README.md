# Statistical Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive statistical analysis project that explores key insights and relationships within the dataset. Advanced statistical methods are used to analyze and interpret data effectively, providing actionable conclusions.

## Features
- **Statistical Techniques**: Implements Poisson distribution, binomial distribution, hypothesis testing, and more.
- **Data Visualization**: Creates insightful visualizations like heatmaps, scatter plots, and confidence intervals to communicate findings.
- **Data Insights**: Focuses on data-driven decision-making by uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships.

## Requirements
To run this project, the following dependencies are required:
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ghanagokul/Stats_Project.git
   cd Stats_Project
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis**:

## Dataset
The dataset analyzed in this project includes:
- Key Features: Specific details related to the domain of the study (e.g., sports analytics, customer trends).
- Format: CSV or Excel, preprocessed for statistical analysis.

Details about the dataset and preprocessing steps are included in the scripts.

## Statistical Methods
This project utilizes the following techniques:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, median, variance, standard deviation.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square tests).
- **Distributions**: Poisson, binomial, and normal distributions.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding relationships between variables.

## Results and Insights
- **Key Findings**: Highlights actionable insights derived from statistical analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Heatmaps, scatter plots, and other charts to illustrate data patterns and support conclusions.

## Future Enhancements
- Include advanced statistical models for predictive analysis.
- Add support for larger datasets and automate preprocessing steps.
- Integrate machine learning for statistical forecasting.
